```

### Analyzing Data
To analyze data, use the provided scripts:

```bash
python analyze_data.py data_file.csv
```

## Examples
### Example 1: Heat Transfer Simulation
This example demonstrates how to simulate heat transfer between two bodies. The script `heat_transfer.py` allows you to set initial temperatures and observe the energy exchange over time.

```python
# heat_transfer.py
initial_temp_body1 = 100  # degrees Celsius
initial_temp_body2 = 20   # degrees Celsius
time_duration = 60        # seconds

simulate_heat_transfer(initial_temp_body1, initial_temp_body2, time_duration)
```

### Example 2: Thermal Conductivity Calculation
You can calculate the thermal conductivity of materials using the script `thermal_conductivity.py`. Input the necessary parameters and get the results.

```python
# thermal_conductivity.py
material = "Copper"
thickness = 0.01  # meters
area = 0.1       # square meters
temperature_difference = 50  # degrees Celsius

conductivity = calculate_thermal_conductivity(material, thickness, area, temperature_difference)
print(f"The thermal conductivity of {material} is {conductivity} W/m¬∑K")
```
